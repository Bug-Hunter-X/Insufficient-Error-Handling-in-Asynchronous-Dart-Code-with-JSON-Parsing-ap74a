# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code with JSON Parsing

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling when dealing with asynchronous operations and JSON parsing. The `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from an API, parses it as JSON, and then attempts to access specific fields.  However, it lacks robust error handling and type checking.

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling, demonstrating best practices for handling potential exceptions and ensuring type safety.
